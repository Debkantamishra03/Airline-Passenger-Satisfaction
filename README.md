# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis 

Airline companies want to understand what drives customer satisfaction. Using Kaggleâ€™s dataset of airline passenger feedback, we analyze patterns in satisfaction based on demographics, travel type, and service factors.

## Project Overview
1. Data Cleaning
   - Handled missing values in `Arrival Delay in Minutes` using mean imputation.
   - Dropped irrelevant columns (`Unnamed: 0`, `id`).
   - Categorized `Age` into groups (Child, Young Adult, Adult, Middle Aged, Senior).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Gender distribution
   - Customer type (Loyal vs. Disloyal)
   - Age group distribution
   - Travel type & Class
   - Satisfaction levels

3. Visualization
   - Multiple pie charts showing distribution
   - Comparative analysis of satisfaction percentages
